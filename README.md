## Overview

This is a working project of a simple JS connect four game. There are some features yet to be added, such as win count and local storage memory. I will also add disc animation when clicked. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the game rules
- Play a game of Connect Four against another human player (alternating turns on the same computer)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size (working on mobile and tablet ver)
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS custom properties
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I learnt this "climbing stairs" coding logic and it's super useful when looping through possibilities. I also had a better understanding in some basic gaming logics. Would be fun if I could build this into a player vs pc game! 

### Continued development

I will keep on adding features and updated tablet and mobile layout. (Keep on learning!!)
